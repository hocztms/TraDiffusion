We present TraDiffusion, a training-free, trajectory-based controllable Text-to-Image (T2I) method. Unlike traditional box- or mask-based approaches, TraDiffusion allows users to guide image generation with mouse trajectories. It utilizes the Distance Awareness energy function to focus generation within the defined trajectory. Our comparisons with traditional methods show that TraDiffusion offers simpler and more natural control. Additionally, it effectively manipulates salient regions, attributes, and relationships within generated images using arbitrary or enhanced trajectories.

## Model Overview

TraDiffusion uses a pretrained diffusion model and implements a Distance Awareness energy function combined with trajectories to achieve training-free layout control.

## Quick Start 

### Environment Setup

You can easily set up a environment according to the following command:
```buildoutcfg
conda create -n traces-guidance python=3.8
conda activate traces-guidance
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Inference

We provide an example in `inference,py`. The corresponding information will saved in path `./example_output`.  Detail configuration can be found in the `./conf/base_config.yaml` and `inference.py`. You can quickly use with the following commands:
```buildoutcfg
python inference.py general.save_path=./example_output 
```

### Gradio Demo
We also provide a gradio project that you can quickly use with the following commands:
```buildoutcfg
python inference_gradio.py 
```
Here we provide an example of using a Gradio program.
